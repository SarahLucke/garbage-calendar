# Garbage Calendar

This Python tool requests the future garbage collection schedule from the jumomind webservice. The received data is used to output a garbage collection calendar in excel or pdf that is ready to be printed as seen below.

## Implementation

The project uses the [requests package](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) to read in information from the webservice.  
For writing the gathered information into the excel file, the [openpyxl package](https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/) is required.  
The same is done with for pdf using [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/).

The project uses **Python3**. According to [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)
> Python comes preinstalled on most Linux distributions, and is available as a package on all others.
